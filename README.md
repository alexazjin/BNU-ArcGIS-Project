"Multi-Dimensional Big Data Analysis of Population Geospatial Distribution and its Interaction with Built Environment in Central Beijing"

##Preparation:
Observing that certain blocks in Beijing are consistently more popular than others, I read urban sociologist Jane Jacobs' book The Death and Life of Great American Cities and confirmed that shorter city blocks attract more pedestrians and commercial points. I also investigated this idea in the context of ancient Beijing by visiting the Beijing Planning Exhibition Hall.To prepare myself technically, I took Tsinghua University online course Big Data and Urban Planning to study urban geospatial research topics and operation of ArcGIS, and I studied methodologies of relevant statistical analysis in course Elite Plan Math Modeling at Beijing Normal University.

##Abstract:
Based on geospatial big data (in shapefile format) of population points of interest (POI) and built environment (including intersections and geo-grids) of Central Beijing, we utilize ArcGIS (Geographic Information System) to conduct data visualization, spatial autocorrelation analysis, cluster and outlier analysis, and geographically weighted regression (GWR) regarding geospatial characteristics of population density distribution. We also conduct multiple linear regression analysis with R to explore statistical correlation between pedestrian and intersection density.
We find that population hotspots in Central Beijing overlap with major commercial districts and that population and intersection density have strong numerical and spatial correlation. From Moran's I and the associated p-value, we argue that population density in Central Beijing has substantial spatial autocorrelation.
